# AdblockConsolidated

Was getting tired of Pi-hole slowing down due to too many filters so I decided to extract every list I had installed to clean up duplicates and created one consolidated list with no repeating links. I have also removed my complete allow list from the new blocklist so I can keep that clearn

Need to find a way to keep this list updated with future changes. 

Any help welcome.
